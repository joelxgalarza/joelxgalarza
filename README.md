Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Auri a tool that automates content creation and posting
- 🌱 I’m currently learning fun subjects like calculus, web development, and how to implement graph api
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with others to build projects and contribute to a shared goal.
- 📫 How to reach me: contact@joelgalarza.com
